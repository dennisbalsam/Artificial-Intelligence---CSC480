to illusrate the law of large numbers, which is a that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times, and as the number of trials 
increases, its mean grows closer to the average.
These are results of flipping a coin, with the amount of flips increasing on every trial until 100 million

As the Iterations increase the percentage of each coin side gets closer and closer to 50%
